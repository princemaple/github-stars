Paper Mono
==========

A beautiful monospace font for design and code by Paper.

Installation
------------

Download the latest release from the releases page and install the fonts on your system.

Building
--------

Fonts are built automatically by GitHub Actions - take a look in the "Actions" tab for the latest build.

If you want to build fonts manually on your own computer:

-   `make build` will produce font files.
-   `make test` will run FontBakery's quality assurance tests.
-   `make proof` will generate HTML proof files.

The proof files and QA tests are also available automatically via GitHub Actions - look at https://paper-design.github.io/paper-mono.
