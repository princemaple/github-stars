OhEarningsCal
=============

Subscribe to US stock earnings dates from your calendar app. This started as a tool I built for myself — I'd rather glance at my calendar than open a brokerage app — and turned out useful enough to open-source.

Just use it
-----------

Visit https://earnings.beavern.com/, pick a calendar, copy the link, then add it as a calendar subscription in your app of choice.

The calendars cover the US market only, in a rolling window of ±30 days around today (anything further out isn't accurate enough to matter).

Calendars
---------

File

Contents

`all.ics`

Every company that reports earnings in the window

`nasdaq100.ics`

Nasdaq-100 constituents

`sp500.ics`

S&P 500 constituents

`dow30.ics`

Dow Jones Industrial Average constituents

`customstock.ics`

A custom watchlist driven by the `CUSTOM_STOCKS` env var

`selected.ics`

Union of the four above, deduplicated

Self-hosting
------------

1.  Fork this repo
2.  **Settings → Pages → Source** → switch to **GitHub Actions**
3.  **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables** → add:
    -   `SHOULD_GEN_SELECTED` = `true` / `false`
    -   `SHOULD_GEN_ALL` = `true` / `false`
    -   `CUSTOM_STOCKS` = comma-separated tickers, e.g. `PDD,BABA,TCEHY` (leave empty to skip `customstock.ics`)
4.  Wait for the next scheduled run, or kick off **Actions → Update earnings calendar → Run workflow** manually.

Automation
----------

Workflow

Schedule

What it does

`earnings.yml`

Daily 04:34 / 16:34 UTC

Fetch earnings → build ics → deploy to GitHub Pages

`indices.yml`

Mondays 06:17 UTC

Refresh index constituents from Wikipedia, commit `data/indices/`

Earnings data is cached in GitHub Actions cache, never in git — `main` only carries source code and the index constituents.

Local development
-----------------

npm install
cp .env.example .env   # edit env vars

npm run fetch:indices  # first run / when refreshing constituents
npm run fetch          # pull yesterday + next 30 days into data/earnings/
npm run gen            # write docs/ics/\*.ics
npm run dev            # http://localhost:18302

Convenience endpoints on the dev server:

-   `GET /dev/fetch` — trigger one `fetch`
-   `GET /dev/fetch-indices` — trigger one `fetch:indices`
-   `GET /dev/gen` — trigger one `gen`
