OpenCode Telegram Bot
=====================

OpenCode Telegram Bot is a secure Telegram client for OpenCode CLI that runs on your local machine.

Run AI coding tasks, monitor progress, switch models, and manage sessions from your phone.

No open ports, no exposed APIs. The bot communicates with your local OpenCode server and the Telegram Bot API only.

Languages: English (`en`), Deutsch (`de`), Español (`es`), Русский (`ru`), 简体中文 (`zh`)

Quick start: `npx @grinev/opencode-telegram-bot`

Features
--------

-   **Remote coding** — send prompts to OpenCode from anywhere, receive complete results with code sent as files
-   **Session management** — create new sessions or continue existing ones, just like in the TUI
-   **Live status** — pinned message with current project, model, context usage, and changed files list, updated in real time
-   **Model switching** — pick models from OpenCode favorites and recent history directly in the chat (favorites are shown first)
-   **Agent modes** — switch between Plan and Build modes on the fly
-   **Interactive Q&A** — answer agent questions and approve permissions via inline buttons
-   **Voice prompts** — send voice/audio messages, transcribe them via a Whisper-compatible API, then forward recognized text to OpenCode
-   **Context control** — compact context when it gets too large, right from the chat
-   **Input flow control** — when an interactive flow is active, the bot accepts only relevant input to keep context consistent and avoid accidental actions
-   **Configurable reply formatting** — assistant replies use Telegram MarkdownV2 by default, with optional raw mode (`MESSAGE_FORMAT_MODE=markdown|raw`)
-   **Security** — strict user ID whitelist; no one else can access your bot, even if they find it
-   **Localization** — UI localization is supported for multiple languages (`BOT_LOCALE`)

Prerequisites
-------------

-   **Node.js 20+** — download
-   **OpenCode** — install from opencode.ai or GitHub
-   **Telegram Bot** — you'll create one during setup (takes 1 minute)

Quick Start
-----------

### 1\. Create a Telegram Bot

1.  Open @BotFather in Telegram and send `/newbot`
2.  Follow the prompts to choose a name and username
3.  Copy the **bot token** you receive (e.g. `123456:ABC-DEF1234...`)

You'll also need your **Telegram User ID** — send any message to @userinfobot and it will reply with your numeric ID.

### 2\. Start OpenCode Server

Start the OpenCode server:

opencode serve

> The bot connects to the OpenCode API at `http://localhost:4096` by default.

### 3\. Install & Run

The fastest way — run directly with `npx`:

npx @grinev/opencode-telegram-bot

On first launch, an interactive wizard will guide you through the configuration — it asks for interface language first, then your bot token, user ID, and OpenCode API URL. After that, you're ready to go. Open your bot in Telegram and start sending tasks.

#### Alternative: Global Install

npm install -g @grinev/opencode-telegram-bot
opencode-telegram start

To reconfigure at any time:

opencode-telegram config

Windows

Fully supported

Linux

Experimental — should work, but has not been extensively tested. You may need additional steps such as granting execute permissions.

Bot Commands
------------

Command

Description

`/status`

Server health, current project, session, and model info

`/new`

Create a new session

`/stop`

Abort the current task

`/sessions`

Browse and switch between recent sessions

`/projects`

Switch between OpenCode projects

`/rename`

Rename the current session

`/opencode_start`

Any regular text message is sent as a prompt to the coding agent only when no blocking interaction is active. Voice/audio messages are transcribed and then sent as prompts when STT is configured.

> `/opencode_start` and `/opencode_stop` are intended as emergency commands — for example, if you need to restart a stuck server while away from your computer. Under normal usage, start `opencode serve` yourself before launching the bot.

Configuration
-------------

### Localization

-   Supported locales: `en`, `de`, `es`, `ru`, `zh`
-   The setup wizard asks for language first
-   You can change locale later with `BOT_LOCALE`

> **Keep your `.env` file private.** It contains your bot token. Never commit it to version control.

### Voice and Audio Transcription (Optional)

If `STT_API_URL` and `STT_API_KEY` are set, the bot will:

1.  Accept `voice` and `audio` Telegram messages
2.  Transcribe them via `POST {STT_API_URL}/audio/transcriptions`
3.  Show recognized text in chat
4.  Send the recognized text to OpenCode as a normal prompt

Supported provider examples (Whisper-compatible):

-   **OpenAI**
    -   `STT_API_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1`
    -   `STT_MODEL=whisper-1`
-   **Groq**
    -   `STT_API_URL=https://api.groq.com/openai/v1`
    -   `STT_MODEL=whisper-large-v3-turbo`
-   **Together**
    -   `STT_API_URL=https://api.together.xyz/v1`
    -   `STT_MODEL=openai/whisper-large-v3`

If STT variables are not set, voice/audio transcription is disabled and the bot will ask you to configure STT.

### Model Configuration

The model picker uses OpenCode local model state (`favorite` + `recent`):

-   Favorites are shown first, then recent
-   Models already in favorites are not duplicated in recent
-   Current model is marked with `✅`
-   Default model from `OPENCODE_MODEL_PROVIDER` + `OPENCODE_MODEL_ID` is always included in favorites

To add a model to favorites, open OpenCode TUI (`opencode`), go to model selection, and press **Cmd+F/Ctrl+F** on the model.

Security
--------

The bot enforces a strict **user ID whitelist**. Only the Telegram user whose numeric ID matches `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_ID` can interact with the bot. Messages from any other user are silently ignored and logged as unauthorized access attempts.

Since the bot runs locally on your machine and connects to your local OpenCode server, there is no external attack surface beyond the Telegram Bot API itself.

Development
-----------

### Running from Source

git clone https://github.com/grinev/opencode-telegram-bot.git
cd opencode-telegram-bot
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your bot token, user ID, and model settings

Build and run:

npm run dev

### Available Scripts

Script

Description

`npm run test:coverage`

Tests with coverage report

> **Note:** No file watcher or auto-restart is used. The bot maintains persistent SSE and long-polling connections — automatic restarts would break them mid-task. After making changes, restart manually with `npm run dev`.

Troubleshooting
---------------

**Bot doesn't respond to messages**

-   Make sure `TELEGRAM_ALLOWED_USER_ID` matches your actual Telegram user ID (check with @userinfobot)
-   Verify the bot token is correct

**"OpenCode server is not available"**

-   Ensure `opencode serve` is running in your project directory
-   Check that `OPENCODE_API_URL` points to the correct address (default: `http://localhost:4096`)

**No models in model picker**

-   Add models to your OpenCode favorites: open OpenCode TUI, go to model selection, press **Ctrl+F** on desired models
-   Verify `OPENCODE_MODEL_PROVIDER` and `OPENCODE_MODEL_ID` point to an available model in your setup

**Linux: permission denied errors**

-   Make sure the CLI binary has execute permission: `chmod +x $(which opencode-telegram)`
-   Check that the config directory is writable: `~/.config/opencode-telegram-bot/`
