scrcpy (v4.1)
=============

_pronounced "**scr**een **c**o**py**"_

This application mirrors Android devices (video and audio) connected via USB or TCP/IP and allows control using the computer's keyboard and mouse. It does not require _root_ access or an app installed on the device. It works on _Linux_, _Windows_, and _macOS_.

     

It focuses on:

-   **lightness**: native, displays only the device screen
-   **performance**: 30~120fps, depending on the device
-   **quality**: 1920×1080 or above
-   **low latency**: 35~70ms
-   **low startup time**: ~1 second to display the first image
-   **non-intrusiveness**: nothing is left installed on the Android device
-   **user benefits**: no account, no ads, no internet required
-   **freedom**: free and open source software

Its features include:

-   audio forwarding (Android 11+)
-   recording
-   virtual display
-   mirroring with Android device screen off
-   copy-paste in both directions
-   configurable quality
-   camera mirroring (Android 12+)
-   mirroring as a webcam (V4L2) (Linux-only)
-   physical keyboard and mouse simulation (HID)
-   gamepad support
-   OTG mode
-   and more…

Prerequisites
-------------

The Android device requires at least API 21 (Android 5.0).

Audio forwarding is supported for API >= 30 (Android 11+).

Make sure you enabled USB debugging on your device(s).

On some devices (especially Xiaomi), you might get the following error:

```
Injecting input events requires the caller (or the source of the instrumentation, if any) to have the INJECT_EVENTS permission.
```

In that case, you need to enable an additional option `USB debugging (Security Settings)` (this is an item different from `USB debugging`) to control it using a keyboard and mouse. Rebooting the device is necessary once this option is set.

Note that USB debugging is not required to run scrcpy in OTG mode.

Get the app
-----------

-   Linux
-   Windows (read how to run)
-   macOS

Must-know tips
--------------

-   Reducing resolution may greatly improve performance (`scrcpy -m1024`)
-   _Right-click_ triggers `BACK`
-   _Middle-click_ triggers `HOME`
-   Alt+f toggles fullscreen
-   There are many other shortcuts

Usage examples
--------------

There are a lot of options, documented in separate pages. Here are just some common examples.

-   Capture the screen in H.265 (better quality), limit the size to 1920, limit the frame rate to 60fps, disable audio, and control the device by simulating a physical keyboard:
    
    scrcpy --video-codec=h265 --max-size=1920 --max-fps=60 --no-audio --keyboard=uhid
    scrcpy --video-codec=h265 -m1920 --max-fps=60 --no-audio -K  # short version
    
-   Start VLC in a new virtual display (separate from the device display):
    
    scrcpy --new-display=1920x1080 --start-app=org.videolan.vlc
    
-   Start VLC in a new _flex_ display using H.265 with a bitrate of 16 Mbps, while keeping the display active so it does not turn off:
    
    scrcpy --new-display -x --keep-active --start-app=org.videolan.vlc --video-codec=h265 -b16M
    
-   Record the device camera in H.265 at 1920x1080 (and microphone) to an MP4 file:
    
    scrcpy --video-source=camera --video-codec=h265 --camera-size=1920x1080 --record=file.mp4
    
-   Capture the device front camera and expose it as a webcam on the computer (on Linux):
    
    scrcpy --video-source=camera --camera-size=1920x1080 --camera-facing=front --v4l2-sink=/dev/video2 --no-playback
    
-   Control the device without mirroring by simulating a physical keyboard and mouse (USB debugging not required):
    
    scrcpy --otg
    
-   Control the device using gamepads plugged into the computer:
    
    scrcpy --gamepad=uhid
    scrcpy -G  # short version
