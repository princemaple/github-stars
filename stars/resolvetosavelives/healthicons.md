Health Icons
============

Free, open source health icons available for any use. Use for your next commercial or personal project. You don’t need to give credit and you can edit the icons however you want. Health Icons is a volunteer effort to create a 'global good' for health projects all over the world. Website: healthicons.org

Using Health Icons
------------------

These icons are available in the public domain (CC0) for use in any type of project. Icons are available in several formats:

-   All icons are produced in "outline" and "filled" styles
-   Each icon is available in SVG and in PNG (48px and 96px)
-   Many icons are also available in a smaller 24px format

Icons can be downloaded:

-   Individually from our website
-   Together as a ZIP file
-   Via NPM: `npm i healthicons` or `yarn add healthicons`

Request a new icon
------------------

Need an icon for your project? Submit a request with an Issue on GitHub using the title `"Icon Request: [name of icon]"` and we will do our best to respond.

How to contribute
-----------------

We’d love for you to join our team of volunteer designers and developers!

1.  Join our open Slack channel by emailing contact@healthicons.org
2.  Browse the Figma and contribute icons in the "New icons" section. Please read the code of conduct (below) and the styleguide (in the Figma) carefully before contributing.

Installing and running the website locally
------------------------------------------

This project uses Next.js.

This is the intended way to contribute to the code base:

1.  Fork the main repo so you have your own copy which will be at `https://github.com/{your-username}/healthicons/`
2.  Check it your fork on your computer: `gh repo clone {your-username}}/healthicons`
3.  Add a remote referencing the main repo: `git remote add upstream git@github.com:resolvetosavelives/healthicons.git`
4.  Fetch the remote upstream using: `git fetch upstream`
5.  Create a new branch based on the RTSL repo’s main branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name upstream/main`
6.  Install dependencies using `yarn install`
7.  Run the project locally using `yarn dev`
8.  Make all of your changes and make a bunch of commits
9.  Push to your branch: `git push origin my-branch-name`
10.  On Github, create a pull request from your branch to `upstream/main`
11.  After that, an admin of the project will review the pull request and then offer feedback and/or merge it

**Importing the latest icon information from Figma**

To pull the latest icon information from Figma, update the open-graph images, and update the sitemap.xml:

1.  Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2.  Go to your account settings on figma.com and generate a new access token under "Personal access tokens" and copy it to your clipboard.
3.  In `.env.local`, add `FIGMA_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN="{token-goes-here}"`
4.  Run `yarn update-icons`
5.  If you're committing to a branch on git, make sure to remember to add the newly generated files in the `/public/` directory.

Publishing new icons to the website
-----------------------------------

1.  Run the website locally (see above)
2.  Delete all of the icons from your local directories `/public/icons/png/` and `/public/icons/svg/`
3.  Go the `Export` page on Figma
4.  Make sure all new icons are tagged (see below)
5.  Export as PNG: Select all of the icons and export all as `1x PNG` and `2x PNG`
6.  Export as SVG: Select all of the icons and export all as `SVG`
7.  In your terminal, type: `yarn update-icons`
8.  Test the website locally at `localhost:4000`
9.  Commit your changes to a new branch on Github
10.  Raise a PR and request a review from another volunteer via Slack
11.  Wait for review
12.  Merge the PR

Tagging icons in Figma
----------------------

**Icon 'Title' and 'Tags' in Figma**

Each icon should have a title and tags which are added in the “Description” field in Figma. The format is: `{title} [{tag1}, {tag2}, {tag3}…, dhis2:{tag}]`

**Some examples:**

`donkey` icon:  
`Donkey [Animal, Ass, Farm, Mule, dhis2:donkey]`

`blood_rh_p` icon:  
`Blood Type RH+ [Blood, RH Positive, dhis2:blood_rh_p]`

**More details:**

-   The “Description” only needs to go on the “filled” version of the icon in Figma
-   Icon titles should be in Title Case with each word capitalized
-   Tags are essentially synonyms or important related words that would help someone find the icon. They could also be alternative uses of the icon, the way a donkey could represent “farm”. If someone searches “blood” or “positive” they’ll see any icons that are tagged with those words. Tags should also be Title Case.

Code of Conduct
---------------

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

### Our standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

-   Using welcoming and inclusive language
-   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
-   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
-   Focusing on what is best for the community
-   Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

-   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
-   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
-   Public or private harassment
-   Publishing others’ private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
-   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

### Our responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

### Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

### Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the project team at contact@healthicons.org. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident. Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project’s leadership.
