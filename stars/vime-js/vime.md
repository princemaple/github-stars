<vm-player autoplay muted\>

    <!-- Why \`data-src\`? Lazy loading. You can always use \`src\` if you don't need it. -->
    <source data-src\="/media/video.mp4" type\="video/mp4" />
    <track
      default
      kind\="subtitles"
      src\="/media/subs/en.vtt"
      srclang\="en"
      label\="English"
    />
  </vm-video\>

  <!-- Loads the default Vime UI. -->
  <vm-default-ui />

    <source data-src\="/media/audio.mp3" type\="audio/mp3" />
  </vm-audio\>
