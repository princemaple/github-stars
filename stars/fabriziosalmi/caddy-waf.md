Caddy WAF
=========

A Web Application Firewall middleware for the Caddy web server, written in Go.

-   **Module ID**: `http.handlers.waf`
-   **Go module path**: `github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf`
-   **Current version**: `v0.3.0` (see `caddywaf.go` — `const wafVersion`)
-   **License**: AGPL-3.0

* * *

Overview
--------

`caddy-waf` is an HTTP handler middleware that inspects requests and responses across four well-defined phases, applies a regular-expression rule set with anomaly scoring, enforces IP/DNS/ASN/country blacklists and whitelists, performs token-bucket-style rate limiting, and exposes a JSON metrics endpoint.

The middleware is implemented as a single Caddy module registered under the ID `http.handlers.waf`. It can be configured through the Caddyfile or directly via JSON.

Capabilities
------------

Capability

Implementation

Regex rule engine

Go `regexp` package (RE2, linear-time guarantee). Compiled patterns are cached per rule ID.

Multi-phase inspection

Phase 1 (request headers and pre-request checks), Phase 2 (request body), Phase 3 (response headers), Phase 4 (response body).

Anomaly scoring

Each rule contributes its `score` to a per-request total; requests are blocked when the total reaches `anomaly_threshold`.

Explicit actions

Rule `mode` of `block` or `log`. `block` short-circuits the request; `log` records the match and continues.

IP blacklist

Plain IPs and CIDR ranges (IPv4 and IPv6) stored in a prefix trie (`go-iptrie`).

DNS blacklist

Exact-match (case-insensitive) host lookup.

GeoIP country block / whitelist

MaxMind GeoLite2 Country MMDB.

ASN block

MaxMind GeoLite2 ASN MMDB.

Tor exit-node block

Periodic fetch from `https://check.torproject.org/torbulkexitlist`.

Rate limiting

Per-IP, sliding-window, optional per-path matching with regex patterns.

Custom block responses

Per-status-code response with custom Content-Type, headers, and body (inline or from file).

Sensitive data redaction

Optional redaction of sensitive query parameters and log fields.

Hot reload

`fsnotify` watchers on rule files, IP blacklist, and DNS blacklist.

Metrics endpoint

JSON document exposed at the configured `metrics_endpoint` path.

Asynchronous logging

Buffered log channel with synchronous fallback when the buffer is full.

Engineering notes
-----------------

-   **Linear-time regex**: rules are compiled by Go's `regexp` (RE2). No catastrophic backtracking.
-   **Wait-free counters**: per-rule hit counts use `atomic.Int64` stored in a `sync.Map`.
-   **Bounded body reads**: request bodies are read through `io.LimitReader` (`max_request_body_size`, default 10 MiB) and restored with `io.MultiReader` so downstream handlers still see the full body.
-   **Zero-copy body string**: the body is exposed to rule matching via `unsafe.String` to avoid an allocation per request.
-   **Circuit breaker for GeoIP**: `geoip_fail_open` controls whether a GeoIP lookup failure blocks the request or allows it through.
-   **Panic recovery**: `ServeHTTP` installs a deferred recovery that returns `500 Internal Server Error` on panic.

Quick start
-----------

The fastest path to a working build:

curl -fsSL -H "Pragma: no-cache" \\
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash

The script ensures Go and `xcaddy` are installed, clones the repository, downloads the GeoLite2 database, builds Caddy with the `caddy-waf` module, and starts the server.

A representative provisioning log:

```
INFO  Provisioning WAF middleware     {"log_level":"info","log_path":"debug.json","log_json":true,"anomaly_threshold":20}
INFO  http.handlers.waf  Tor exit nodes updated  {"count":1093}
INFO  WAF middleware version  {"version":"v0.3.0"}
INFO  Rate limit configuration  {"requests":100,"window":10,"cleanup_interval":300,"paths":["/api/v1/.*"],"match_all_paths":false}
WARN  GeoIP database not found. Country blacklisting/whitelisting will be disabled  {"path":"GeoLite2-Country.mmdb"}
INFO  IP blacklist loaded     {"path":"ip_blacklist.txt","valid_entries":223770,"invalid_entries":0,"total_lines":223770}

```

Installation
------------

### Requirements

-   Go **1.25** or newer (`go.mod` declares `go 1.25`)
-   Caddy **v2.10.x** or newer (current build uses `github.com/caddyserver/caddy/v2 v2.10.2`)
-   `xcaddy` for building Caddy with plugins

### Option 1 — Build with xcaddy (recommended)

go install github.com/caddyserver/xcaddy/cmd/xcaddy@latest
xcaddy build --with github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf
./caddy list-modules | grep waf   # expect: http.handlers.waf

### Option 2 — Quick script

curl -fsSL -H "Pragma: no-cache" \\
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf/refs/heads/main/install.sh | bash

### Option 3 — Build from source

git clone https://github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf.git
cd caddy-waf
go mod tidy
wget https://git.io/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb           # optional, only for GeoIP
xcaddy build --with github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf=./
./caddy fmt --overwrite
./caddy run

### `caddy add-package`

This module is **not registered** in Caddy's official package registry; `caddy add-package github.com/fabriziosalmi/caddy-waf` will fail with `HTTP 400: ... is not a registered Caddy module package path`. Use one of the build options above. See `docs/add-package-guide.md` for details.

Minimal Caddyfile
-----------------

{
    auto\_https off
    admin localhost:2019
}

:8080 {
    log {
        output stdout
        format console
        level INFO
    }

    route {
        waf {
            metrics\_endpoint   /waf\_metrics
            rule\_file          rules.json
            ip\_blacklist\_file  ip\_blacklist.txt
            dns\_blacklist\_file dns\_blacklist.txt
        }

        @wafmetrics path /waf\_metrics
        handle @wafmetrics {
            # Falls through to the WAF handler, which serves metrics as JSON.
        }

        handle {
            respond "Hello world!" 200
        }
    }
}

A fully annotated example is provided in `Caddyfile` and `caddyfile.example`.
