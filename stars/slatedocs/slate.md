Slate was a API documentation generator created by @lord in 2013. It was once used to host API docs for projects at NASA, Sony, Best Buy, Clearbit, Dwolla, Parrot Drones, WooCommerce, and Axidraw, among many others.

As the original creator and administrator of this project, and in the spirit of the various protests and strikes actively going on in the US (as of Jan 2026) I've decided to take it off of GitHub in protest of Microsoft's contracts with ICE and the IDF. You can read more about this decision on my blog. My website also hosts a read-only archive of Slate's code.
