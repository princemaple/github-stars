Star History

✨ Features
----------

Today’s agents are one-off, task-driven tools. They lack context, live in isolation, and require manual hand-offs between different windows and models. While some maintain memory, it is often global, shallow, and impersonal. In this mode, users are forced to toggle between fragmented conversations, making it difficult to form structured productivity.

**LobeHub changes everything.**

LobeHub is a work-and-lifestyle space to find, build, and collaborate with agent teammates that grow with you. In LobeHub, we treat **Agents as the unit of work**, providing an infrastructure where humans and agents co-evolve.

### Create: Agents as the Unit of Work

Building a personalized AI team starts with the **Agent Builder**. You can describe what you need once, and the agent setup starts right away, applying auto-configurations so you can use it instantly.

-   **Unified Intelligence**: Seamlessly access any model and any modality—all under your control.
-   **10,000+ Skills**: Connect your agents to the skills you use every day with a library of over 10,000 tools and MCP-compatible plugins.

### Collaborate: Scale New Forms of Collaboration Networks

LobeHub introduces **Agent Groups**, allowing you to work with agents like real teammates. The system assembles the right agents for the task, enabling parallel collaboration and iterative improvement.

-   **Pages**: Write and refine content with multiple agents in one place with a shared context.
-   **Schedule**: Schedule runs and let agents do the work at the right time, even while you are away.
-   **Project**: Organize work by project to keep everything structured and easy to track.
-   **Workspace**: A shared space for teams to collaborate with agents, ensuring clear ownership and visibility across the organization.

### Evolve: Co-evolution of Humans and Agents

The best AI is one that understands you deeply. LobeHub features **Personal Memory** that builds a clear understanding of your needs.

-   **Continual Learning**: Your agents learn from how you work, adapting their behavior to act at the right moment.
-   **White-Box Memory**: We believe in transparency. Your agents use structured, editable memory, giving you full control over what they remember.

### Multi-Model Service Provider Support

In the continuous development of LobeHub, we deeply understand the importance of diversity in model service providers for meeting the needs of the community when providing AI conversation services. Therefore, we have expanded our support to multiple model service providers, rather than being limited to a single one, in order to offer users a more diverse and rich selection of conversations.

In this way, LobeHub can more flexibly adapt to the needs of different users, while also providing developers with a wider range of choices.

#### Supported Model Service Providers

We have implemented support for the following model service providers:

> 📊 Total providers: **0**

At the same time, we are also planning to support more model service providers. If you would like LobeHub to support your favorite service provider, feel free to join our 💬 community discussion.

### Local Large Language Model (LLM) Support

To meet the specific needs of users, LobeHub also supports the use of local models based on Ollama, allowing users to flexibly use their own or third-party models.

> \[!TIP\]
> 
> Learn more about 📘 Using Ollama in LobeHub by checking it out.

### Model Visual Recognition

LobeHub now supports OpenAI's latest `gpt-4-vision` model with visual recognition capabilities, a multimodal intelligence that can perceive visuals. Users can easily upload or drag and drop images into the dialogue box, and the agent will be able to recognize the content of the images and engage in intelligent conversation based on this, creating smarter and more diversified chat scenarios.

This feature opens up new interactive methods, allowing communication to transcend text and include a wealth of visual elements. Whether it's sharing images in daily use or interpreting images within specific industries, the agent provides an outstanding conversational experience.

### TTS & STT Voice Conversation

LobeHub supports Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies, enabling our application to convert text messages into clear voice outputs, allowing users to interact with our conversational agent as if they were talking to a real person. Users can choose from a variety of voices to pair with the agent.

Moreover, TTS offers an excellent solution for those who prefer auditory learning or desire to receive information while busy. In LobeHub, we have meticulously selected a range of high-quality voice options (OpenAI Audio, Microsoft Edge Speech) to meet the needs of users from different regions and cultural backgrounds. Users can choose the voice that suits their personal preferences or specific scenarios, resulting in a personalized communication experience.

### Text to Image Generation

With support for the latest text-to-image generation technology, LobeHub now allows users to invoke image creation tools directly within conversations with the agent. By leveraging the capabilities of AI tools such as `DALL-E 3`, `MidJourney`, and `Pollinations`, the agents are now equipped to transform your ideas into images.

This enables a more private and immersive creative process, allowing for the seamless integration of visual storytelling into your personal dialogue with the agent.

### Plugin System (Function Calling)

The plugin ecosystem of LobeHub is an important extension of its core functionality, greatly enhancing the practicality and flexibility of the LobeHub assistant.

Plugin-Demo.mp4

By utilizing plugins, LobeHub assistants can obtain and process real-time information, such as searching for web information and providing users with instant and relevant news.

In addition, these plugins are not limited to news aggregation, but can also extend to other practical functions, such as quickly searching documents, generating images, obtaining data from various platforms like Bilibili, Steam, and interacting with various third-party services.

### Support Local / Remote Database

LobeHub supports the use of both server-side and local databases. Depending on your needs, you can choose the appropriate deployment solution:

-   **Local database**: suitable for users who want more control over their data and privacy protection. LobeHub uses CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type) technology to achieve multi-device synchronization. This is an experimental feature aimed at providing a seamless data synchronization experience.
-   **Server-side database**: suitable for users who want a more convenient user experience. LobeHub supports PostgreSQL as a server-side database. For detailed documentation on how to configure the server-side database, please visit Configure Server-side Database.

Regardless of which database you choose, LobeHub can provide you with an excellent user experience.

### Support Multi-User Management

LobeHub supports multi-user management and provides flexible user authentication solutions:

-   **Better Auth**: LobeHub integrates `Better Auth`, a modern and flexible authentication library that supports multiple authentication methods, including OAuth, email login, credential login, magic links, and more. With `Better Auth`, you can easily implement user registration, login, session management, social login, multi-factor authentication (MFA), and other functions to ensure the security and privacy of user data.

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

We deeply understand the importance of providing a seamless experience for users in today's multi-device environment. Therefore, we have adopted Progressive Web Application (PWA) technology, a modern web technology that elevates web applications to an experience close to that of native apps.

Through PWA, LobeHub can offer a highly optimized user experience on both desktop and mobile devices while maintaining high-performance characteristics. Visually and in terms of feel, we have also meticulously designed the interface to ensure it is indistinguishable from native apps, providing smooth animations, responsive layouts, and adapting to different device screen resolutions.

> \[!NOTE\]
> 
> If you are unfamiliar with the installation process of PWA, you can add LobeHub as your desktop application (also applicable to mobile devices) by following these steps:
> 
> -   Launch the Chrome or Edge browser on your computer.
> -   Visit the LobeHub webpage.
> -   In the upper right corner of the address bar, click on the Install icon.
> -   Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the PWA Installation.

### Mobile Device Adaptation

We have carried out a series of optimization designs for mobile devices to enhance the user's mobile experience. Currently, we are iterating on the mobile user experience to achieve smoother and more intuitive interactions. If you have any suggestions or ideas, we welcome you to provide feedback through GitHub Issues or Pull Requests.

### Custom Themes

As a design-engineering-oriented application, LobeHub places great emphasis on users' personalized experiences, hence introducing flexible and diverse theme modes, including a light mode for daytime and a dark mode for nighttime. Beyond switching theme modes, a range of color customization options allow users to adjust the application's theme colors according to their preferences. Whether it's a desire for a sober dark blue, a lively peach pink, or a professional gray-white, users can find their style of color choices in LobeHub.

> \[!TIP\]
> 
> The default configuration can intelligently recognize the user's system color mode and automatically switch themes to ensure a consistent visual experience with the operating system. For users who like to manually control details, LobeHub also offers intuitive setting options and a choice between chat bubble mode and document mode for conversation scenarios.

### `*` What's more
