ZLocation
=========

Tracks your most used directories, based on number of previously run commands. After a short learning phase, `z` will take you to the most popular directory that matches all of the regular expressions given on the command line. You can use **Tab-Completion / Intellisense** to pick directories that are not the first choice.

ZLocation is the successor of Jump-Location. Like z.sh is a reimagined clone of autojump, Zlocation is a reimagined clone of Jump-Location.

Usage
-----

ZLocation keeps track of your `$pwd` (current folder). Once visited, folder become known to ZLocation. You can `cd` with just a hint of the path!

The full command name is `Invoke-ZLocation`, but in examples I use alias `z`. It's all about navigation speed, isn't it?

```
PS C:\Users\sevoroby> z c:
PS C:\> z zlo
PS C:\dev\ZLocation> z dsc
PS C:\dev\azure-sdk-tools\src\ServiceManagement\Compute\Commands.ServiceManagement\IaaS\Extensions\DSC> z test
PS C:\dev\ZLocation\ZLocation.Tests>
```

### List known locations

`z` without arguments will list all the known locations and their weights (short-cut for `Get-ZLocation`)

To see all locations matched to a query `foo` use `z -l foo`.

### Navigating to less common directories with tab completion

If `z mydir` doesn't take you to the correct directory, you can also tab through ZLocation's suggestions.

For example, pressing tab with `z src` will take you through all of ZLocation's completions for `src`.

### Going back

ZLocation keeps a stack of directories as you jump between them. `z -` will "pop" the stack: it will move you to the previous directory you jumped to, basically letting you undo your `z` navigation.

If the stack is empty (you have only jumped once), `z -` will take you to your original directory.

For example:

C:\\\>z foo
C:\\foo\>z bar
C:\\baz\\bar\> z \-
C:\\foo\>z \-
C:\\\>z \-
C:\\\>#no-op

Goals / Key features
--------------------

-   Support for multiple PS sessions.
-   Good built-in ranking algorithm.
-   Customizable matching algorithm and weight function.
-   Works on Windows, Linux and MacOS.

Install
-------

Install from PowerShellGet Gallery

Install-Module ZLocation \-Scope CurrentUser

Make sure to **include ZLocation import in your `$PROFILE`**. It intentionally doesn't alter `$PROFILE` automatically on installation.

This one-liner installs ZLocation, imports it and adds it to a profile.

Install-Module ZLocation \-Scope CurrentUser; Import-Module ZLocation; Add-Content \-Value "\`r\`n\`r\`nImport-Module ZLocation\`r\`n" \-Encoding utf8 \-Path $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts

If you want to display some additional information about ZLocation on start-up, you can put this snippet in `$PROFILE` after import.

Write-Host \-Foreground Green "\`n\[ZLocation\] knows about $((Get-ZLocation).Keys.Count) locations.\`n"

### Note

ZLocation alternates your prompt function to track the location. Meaning if you use this module with other modules that modifies your prompt function (e.g. such as `posh-git`), then you'd need to adjust your Powershell profile file. The statement `Import-Module ZLocation` needs to be placed **after** the other module imports that modifies your prompt function.

You can open up `profile.ps1` through using any of the below commands:

notepad $PROFILE.CurrentUserAllHosts
notepad $env:USERPROFILE\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\profile.ps1
notepad $Home\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\profile.ps1

Alternatively, type up the below in your file explorer, and then edit the `profile.ps1` file with an editor of your choice:

```
%USERPROFILE%\Documents\WindowsPowerShell
```
