OpenCut
=======

### A free, open-source video editor for web, desktop, and mobile.

Sponsors
--------

Thanks to Vercel and fal.ai for their support of open-source software.

Why?
----

-   **Privacy**: Your videos stay on your device
-   **Free features**: Most basic CapCut features are now paywalled
-   **Simple**: People want editors that are easy to use - CapCut proved that

Project Structure
-----------------

-   `apps/web/`: Next.js web application
-   `apps/desktop/`: Native desktop app built with GPUI (in progress)
-   `rust/`: Platform-agnostic core: GPU compositor, effects, masks, and WASM bindings. We're actively migrating business logic here from TypeScript.
-   `docs/`: Architecture and subsystem documentation

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

-   Bun
-   Docker and Docker Compose

> **Note:** Docker is optional but recommended for running the local database and Redis. If you only want to work on frontend features, you can skip it.

### Setup

1.  Fork and clone the repository
    
2.  Copy the environment file:
    
    # Unix/Linux/Mac
    cp apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
    
    # Windows PowerShell
    Copy-Item apps/web/.env.example apps/web/.env.local
    
3.  Start the database and Redis:
    
    docker compose up -d db redis serverless-redis-http
    
4.  Install dependencies and start the dev server:
    
    bun install
    bun dev:web
    

The application will be available at http://localhost:3000.

The `.env.example` has sensible defaults that match the Docker Compose config — it should work out of the box.

### Desktop setup

Desktop is opt-in. If you're only working on the web app, skip this entirely.

If you want to get ready for `apps/desktop`, see `apps/desktop/README.md`. It's a two-step setup: Rust toolchain first, then desktop native dependencies.

### Local WASM development

Only needed if you're editing `rust/wasm` and want the web app to use your local build instead of the published package.

**Prerequisites** — install these once before anything else:

# Rust toolchain
curl --proto '\=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# build the WASM package
cargo install wasm-pack

# reruns the build on file changes, used by bun dev:wasm
cargo install cargo-watch

1.  Build the package once from the repo root:
    
    bun run build:wasm
    
2.  Register the generated package for linking:
    
    cd rust/wasm/pkg
    bun link
    
3.  Link `apps/web` to the local package:
    
    cd apps/web
    bun link opencut-wasm
    
4.  Rebuild on changes while you work:
    
    bun dev:wasm
    

To switch `apps/web` back to the published package, run:

cd apps/web
bun add opencut-wasm

### Self-Hosting with Docker

To run everything (including a production build of the app) in Docker:

docker compose up -d

The app will be available at http://localhost:3100.

Contributing
------------

We welcome contributions! While we're actively developing and refactoring certain areas, there are plenty of opportunities to contribute effectively.

**🎯 Focus areas:** Timeline functionality, project management, performance, bug fixes, and UI improvements outside the preview panel.

**⚠️ Avoid for now:** Preview panel enhancements (fonts, stickers, effects) and export functionality - we're refactoring these with a new binary rendering approach.

See our Contributing Guide for detailed setup instructions, development guidelines, and complete focus area guidance.

**Quick start for contributors:**

-   Fork the repo and clone locally
-   Follow the setup instructions in CONTRIBUTING.md
-   Working on `apps/desktop`? See `apps/desktop/README.md` for setup
-   Create a feature branch and submit a PR
