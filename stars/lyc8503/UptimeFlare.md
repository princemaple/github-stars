✔UptimeFlare
============

A more advanced, serverless, and free uptime monitoring & status page solution, powered by Cloudflare Workers, complete with a user-friendly interface.

📢 **\[SECURITY ADVISORY 2026/03/04\]** A vulnerability (CVE-2026-29779) that could expose monitor configuration and credentials in `uptime.config.ts` to clients was fixed. Versions between 2025-09-21 (from commit `41257c6`) and 2026-03-04 are affected. **Affected users are strongly advised to upgrade to the latest version.**

🎉 **\[UPDATE 2026/01/03\]** I have just migrated UptimeFlare from KV to D1 Database. I also updated the Terraform Cloudflare provider to v5 and improved the deployment process. The data structure has been optimized to resolve long-standing performance issues.

New users can deploy directly, while existing users can have a simple auto migration process (upgrade docs below)! Feel free to open an issue if you run into any trouble deploying.
