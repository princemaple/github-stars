Auto-upstall
------------

Auto-upstall is a single command that sets up NocoDB on a server for production usage. Behind the scenes it auto-generates docker-compose for you.

bash <(curl -sSL http://install.nocodb.com/noco.sh) <(mktemp)

Auto-upstall does the following: 🕊

-   🐳 Automatically installs all pre-requisites like docker, docker-compose
-   🚀 Automatically installs NocoDB with PostgreSQL, Redis, Minio, Traefik gateway using Docker Compose. 🐘 🗄️ 🌐
-   🔄 Automatically upgrades NocoDB to the latest version when you run the command again.
-   🔒 Automatically setups SSL and also renews it. Needs a domain or subdomain as input while installation.

> install.nocodb.com/noco.sh script can be found here in our github

Why are we building this?
=========================

Most internet businesses equip themselves with either spreadsheet or a database to solve their business needs. Spreadsheets are used by Billion+ humans collaboratively every single day. However, we are way off working at similar speeds on databases which are way more powerful tools when it comes to computing. Attempts to solve this with SaaS offerings have meant horrible access controls, vendor lock-in, data lock-in, abrupt price changes & most importantly a glass ceiling on what's possible in the future.

Our Mission
===========

Our mission is to provide the most powerful no-code interface for databases, accessible to every internet business across the world. By making this capability broadly available under a fair and sustainable model, we aim to democratise access to powerful computing tools and enable a billion-plus people to develop radical tinkering and building abilities on the internet.
