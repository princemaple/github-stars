_Protocol and Reference Implementation_

Mercure is a protocol for pushing data updates to web browsers and other HTTP clients in a convenient, fast, reliable, and battery-efficient way. It is especially useful to publish async and real-time updates of resources served through web APIs, to reactive web and mobile apps.

-   Getting started
-   Full documentation
-   Demo

The protocol is maintained in this repository and is also available as an Internet-Draft.

A reference, production-grade, implementation of **a Mercure hub** (the server) is also available in this repository. It's free software (AGPL) written in Go. It is provided along with a library that can be used in any Go application to implement the Mercure protocol directly (without a hub) and an official Docker image.

In addition, a managed and high-scalability version of the Mercure.rocks hub is available on Mercure.rocks.
