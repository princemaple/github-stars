Chatterbox TTS
==============

\_Made with ♥️ by

We're excited to introduce **Chatterbox Multilingual**, Resemble AI's first production-grade open source TTS model supporting **23 languages** out of the box. Licensed under MIT, Chatterbox has been benchmarked against leading closed-source systems like ElevenLabs, and is consistently preferred in side-by-side evaluations.

Whether you're working on memes, videos, games, or AI agents, Chatterbox brings your content to life across languages. It's also the first open source TTS model to support **emotion exaggeration control** with robust **multilingual zero-shot voice cloning**. Try the english only version now on our English Hugging Face Gradio app.. Or try the multilingual version on our Multilingual Hugging Face Gradio app..

If you like the model but need to scale or tune it for higher accuracy, check out our competitively priced TTS service (link). It delivers reliable performance with ultra-low latency of sub 200ms—ideal for production use in agents, applications, or interactive media.

Key Details
===========

-   Multilingual, zero-shot TTS supporting 23 languages
-   SoTA zeroshot English TTS
-   0.5B Llama backbone
-   Unique exaggeration/intensity control
-   Ultra-stable with alignment-informed inference
-   Trained on 0.5M hours of cleaned data
-   Watermarked outputs
-   Easy voice conversion script
-   Outperforms ElevenLabs

Supported Languages
===================

Arabic (ar) • Danish (da) • German (de) • Greek (el) • English (en) • Spanish (es) • Finnish (fi) • French (fr) • Hebrew (he) • Hindi (hi) • Italian (it) • Japanese (ja) • Korean (ko) • Malay (ms) • Dutch (nl) • Norwegian (no) • Polish (pl) • Portuguese (pt) • Russian (ru) • Swedish (sv) • Swahili (sw) • Turkish (tr) • Chinese (zh)

Tips
====

-   **General Use (TTS and Voice Agents):**
    
    -   Ensure that the reference clip matches the specified language tag. Otherwise, language transfer outputs may inherit the accent of the reference clip’s language. To mitigate this, set `cfg_weight` to `0`.
    -   The default settings (`exaggeration=0.5`, `cfg_weight=0.5`) work well for most prompts across all languages.
    -   If the reference speaker has a fast speaking style, lowering `cfg_weight` to around `0.3` can improve pacing.
-   **Expressive or Dramatic Speech:**
    
    -   Try lower `cfg_weight` values (e.g. `~0.3`) and increase `exaggeration` to around `0.7` or higher.
    -   Higher `exaggeration` tends to speed up speech; reducing `cfg_weight` helps compensate with slower, more deliberate pacing.

Installation
============

pip install chatterbox-tts

Alternatively, you can install from source:

# conda create -yn chatterbox python=3.11
# conda activate chatterbox

git clone https://github.com/resemble-ai/chatterbox.git
cd chatterbox
pip install -e .

We developed and tested Chatterbox on Python 3.11 on Debian 11 OS; the versions of the dependencies are pinned in `pyproject.toml` to ensure consistency. You can modify the code or dependencies in this installation mode.

Usage
=====

import torchaudio as ta
from chatterbox.tts import ChatterboxTTS
from chatterbox.mtl\_tts import ChatterboxMultilingualTTS

\# English example
model \= ChatterboxTTS.from\_pretrained(device\="cuda")

text \= "Ezreal and Jinx teamed up with Ahri, Yasuo, and Teemo to take down the enemy's Nexus in an epic late-game pentakill."
wav \= model.generate(text)
ta.save("test-english.wav", wav, model.sr)

\# Multilingual examples
multilingual\_model \= ChatterboxMultilingualTTS.from\_pretrained(device\=device)

french\_text \= "Bonjour, comment ça va? Ceci est le modèle de synthèse vocale multilingue Chatterbox, il prend en charge 23 langues."
wav\_french \= multilingual\_model.generate(spanish\_text, language\_id\="fr")
ta.save("test-french.wav", wav\_french, model.sr)

chinese\_text \= "你好，今天天气真不错，希望你有一个愉快的周末。"
wav\_chinese \= multilingual\_model.generate(chinese\_text, language\_id\="zh")
ta.save("test-chinese.wav", wav\_chinese, model.sr)

\# If you want to synthesize with a different voice, specify the audio prompt
AUDIO\_PROMPT\_PATH \= "YOUR\_FILE.wav"
wav \= model.generate(text, audio\_prompt\_path\=AUDIO\_PROMPT\_PATH)
ta.save("test-2.wav", wav, model.sr)

See `example_tts.py` and `example_vc.py` for more examples.

Built-in PerTh Watermarking for Responsible AI
==============================================

Every audio file generated by Chatterbox includes Resemble AI's Perth (Perceptual Threshold) Watermarker - imperceptible neural watermarks that survive MP3 compression, audio editing, and common manipulations while maintaining nearly 100% detection accuracy.

Watermark extraction
--------------------

You can look for the watermark using the following script.

import perth
import librosa

AUDIO\_PATH \= "YOUR\_FILE.wav"

\# Load the watermarked audio
watermarked\_audio, sr \= librosa.load(AUDIO\_PATH, sr\=None)

\# Initialize watermarker (same as used for embedding)
watermarker \= perth.PerthImplicitWatermarker()

\# Extract watermark
watermark \= watermarker.get\_watermark(watermarked\_audio, sample\_rate\=sr)
print(f"Extracted watermark: {watermark}")
\# Output: 0.0 (no watermark) or 1.0 (watermarked)
