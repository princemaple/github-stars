Pythonx
=======

Python interpreter embedded in Elixir.

Pythonx runs a Python interpreter in the same OS process as your Elixir application, allowing you to evaluate Python code and conveniently convert between Python and Elixir data structures.

The goal of this project is to better integrate Python workflows within Livebook and its usage in actual projects must be done with care due to Python's global interpreter lock (GIL), which prevents multiple threads from executing Python code at the same time. Consequently, calling `Pythonx` from multiple Elixir processes does not provide the concurrency you might expect and thus it can be a source of bottlenecks. However, this concerns regular Python code. Packages with CPU-intense functionality, such as `numpy`, have native implementation of many functions and invoking those releases the GIL. GIL is also released when waiting on I/O operations. In other words, if you are using this library to integrate with Python, make sure it happens in a single Elixir process or that its underlying libraries can deal with concurrent invocation. Otherwise, prefer to use Elixir's `System.cmd/3` or `Port`s to manage multiple Python programs via I/O.

Usage (script)
--------------

Add Pythonx to your dependencies:

Mix.install(\[
  {:pythonx, "~> 0.4.0"}
\])

Initialize the interpreter, specifying the desired Python version and dependencies:

Pythonx.uv\_init("""
\[project\]
name = "project"
version = "0.0.0"
requires-python = "==3.13.\*"
dependencies = \[
  "numpy==2.2.2"
\]
""")

Evaluate Python code:

{result, globals} \=
  Pythonx.eval(
    """
    y = 10
    x + y
    """,
    %{"x" \=> 1}
  )

Pythonx.decode(result)
#=> 11

globals
#=> %{
#=>   "x" => #Pythonx.Object<
#=>     1
#=>   >,
#=>   "y" => #Pythonx.Object<
#=>     10
#=>   >
#=> }

In a dynamic evaluation environment, such as IEx and Livebook, you can also use the `~PY` sigil:

import Pythonx

x \= 1

~PY"""
y = 10
result = x + y
"""

result
#=> #Pythonx.Object<
#=>   11
#=> >

y
#=> #Pythonx.Object<
#=>   10
#=> >

Usage (application)
-------------------

Add Pythonx to your dependencies:

def deps do
  \[
    {:pythonx, "~> 0.4.0"}
  \]
end

Configure the desired Python version and dependencies in your `config/config.exs`:

import Config

config :pythonx, :uv\_init,
  pyproject\_toml: """
  \[project\]
  name = "project"
  version = "0.0.0"
  requires-python = "==3.13.\*"
  dependencies = \[
    "numpy==2.2.2"
  \]
  """

Additionally, you can configure a specific version of the uv package manager for Pythonx to use. This can impact the available Python versions.

import Config

config :pythonx, :uv\_init,
  ...,
  uv\_version: "0.7.21"

With that, you can use `Pythonx.eval/2` and other APIs in your application. The downloads will happen at compile time, and the interpreter will get initialized automatically on boot. All necessary files are placed in Pythonx priv directory, so it is compatible with Elixir releases.

Note that currently the `~PY` sigil does not work as part of Mix project code. This limitation is intentional, since in actual applications it is preferable to manage the Python globals explicitly.

How it works
------------

CPython (the reference implementation of the Python programming language) provides a `python` executable that runs Python code, and that is the usual interface that developers use to interact with the interpreter. However, most the CPython functionality is also available as a dynamically linked library (`.so`, `.dylib` or `.dll`, depending on the platform). The `python` executable can be thought of as a program build on top of that library.

With this design, any C/C++ application can link the Python library and use its API to execute Python code and interact with Python objects on a low level. Taking this a step further, any language with C/C++ interoperability can interact with Python in the same manner. This usage of CPython is referred to as embedding Python.

Elixir provides C/C++ interoperability via Erlang NIFs and that is exactly how Pythonx embeds Python. As a result, the Python interpreter operates in the same OS process as the BEAM.

For more details refer to the official documentation on embedding Python.
