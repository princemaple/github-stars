Hysteria is a powerful, lightning fast and censorship resistant proxy.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### Get Started

### 中文文档

### Hysteria 1.x (legacy)

* * *

### 🛠️ Jack of all trades

Wide range of modes including SOCKS5, HTTP Proxy, TCP/UDP Forwarding, Linux TProxy, TUN - with more features being added constantly.

### ⚡ Blazing fast

Powered by a customized QUIC protocol, Hysteria is designed to deliver unparalleled performance over unreliable and lossy networks.

### ✊ Censorship resistant

The protocol masquerades as standard HTTP/3 traffic, making it very difficult for censors to detect and block without widespread collateral damage.

### 💻 Cross-platform

We have builds for every major platform and architecture. Deploy anywhere & use everywhere. Not to mention the long list of 3rd party apps.

### 🔗 Easy integration

With built-in support for custom authentication, traffic statistics & access control, Hysteria is easy to integrate into your infrastructure.

### 🤗 Chill and supportive

We have well-documented specifications and code for developers to contribute and/or build their own apps. And a helpful community, too.
