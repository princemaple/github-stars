thumbor is a smart imaging service that enables on-demand cropping, resizing, applying filters and optimizing images.

Cropping photos automatically can be a frustrating experience with severed heads involved. thumbor uses AI for smart detection.

thumbor is an HTTP server and you can create as many different images as you want just by varying path parameters:

```
http://<thumbor-server>/300x200/smart/thumbor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_images/logo-thumbor.png
```

You should see an image of the thumbor logo in 300x200.

Learn more about all you can do in thumbor's documentation.
