CAD-Viewer
==========

简体中文

cad-viewer is `the first web-based DXF/DWG viewer and editor in the world that operates entirely in browser, without relying on any backend services`. By performing DWG/DXF parsing, geometry processing, and rendering directly in the browser, cad-viewer enables true serverless CAD viewing and editing, ideal for cloud apps, offline usage, and privacy-sensitive workflows.

It also offers something you will rarely find in other CAD viewers—**one-click export to a single, self-contained HTML file**. The downloaded `.html` embeds the drawing snapshot and a lightweight viewer runtime, so recipients can open, pan, zoom, toggle layers, and measure distances in any modern browser with **no CAD app, no server, and no install**. Most desktop and web CAD viewers only let you view inside their own product; cad-viewer turns a live drawing into a portable, offline artifact you can email, archive, or drop on a static file host—ideal for sharing with clients, compliance archives, and air-gapped workflows. The offline viewer also uses far less memory than traditional desktop tools when opening the same drawing (see memory comparison below).

Plugin System
-------------

CAD-Viewer is built around a modular **plugin system** in `@mlightcad/cad-simple-viewer`. Plugins implement the `AcApPlugin` interface and hook into viewer lifecycle via `onLoad` / `onUnload`—typically to register commands, add UI, or wire export/import pipelines.

Load plugins through `AcApDocManager.instance.pluginManager` (`loadPlugin`, `registerLazyPlugin`, or `plugins.fromConfig` when creating the document manager). Export-oriented plugins support **lazy loading**: register a small stub up front and download the heavy bundle only when the user runs the related command (for example `-chtml`, or when confirming export from the `chtml` dialog in `cad-viewer`).

The monorepo ships several first-party plugins. Each focuses on one concern; combine them as needed. **Installation, registration, and API details live in each package’s README**—see the links below.

### Official plugins

Package

Role

Commands / capabilities

`@mlightcad/cad-simple-ui-plugin`

**Toolbar & layer manager UI** for `cad-simple-viewer` (plain DOM, no Vue/React)

`layer`, default toolbar (view, measure, export, review, theme, locale)

`@mlightcad/cad-agent-plugin`

**Natural-language CAD agent** (AI chat panel + drawing tool calls)

`agent`

`@mlightcad/cad-html-plugin`

Export drawings to **self-contained offline HTML**

`chtml` (dialog in `cad-viewer`), `-chtml` (command-line)

`@mlightcad/cad-pdf-plugin`

**PDF export and import** (vector pipeline)

`cpdf`, `ipdf`

`@mlightcad/cad-svg-plugin`

**SVG export** and shared vector renderer (also used by PDF export)

`csvg`

### `@mlightcad/cad-simple-ui-plugin` — UI chrome for the simple viewer

`cad-simple-viewer` deliberately ships **no application UI**—only the canvas and CAD core. If you embed the simple viewer in your own web app and want ready-made chrome without adopting the full Vue-based `cad-viewer` shell, **`cad-simple-ui-plugin` is the intended UI layer**.

It provides:

-   A **configurable toolbar** (placement on any edge, default CAD commands, nested menus, custom items)
-   A **floating layer manager** (layer on/off, ACI color picker, zoom-to-layer on double-click)
-   **Theme sync** with the `COLORTHEME` sysvar and `--ml-ui-*` CSS tokens on your host element
-   **Locale sync** with `AcApI18n` (English / Chinese)

All widgets are framework-agnostic (plain DOM). The full Vue `cad-viewer` app has its own Element Plus UI and does not require this plugin; use `cad-simple-ui-plugin` when you build on `cad-simple-viewer` directly.

→ **Quick start, toolbar customization, and options:** packages/cad-simple-ui-plugin/README.md

### `@mlightcad/cad-agent-plugin` — AI drawing assistant

`cad-agent-plugin` adds a **natural-language CAD agent** to `cad-simple-viewer`\-based apps. Users describe what they want in plain language; the agent calls CAD tools to inspect the drawing and create or modify geometry.

It provides:

-   A **lazy-loaded** `AcApPlugin` (trigger command: `agent`) so the AI bundle is not on the critical path
-   A **Vue chat panel** (`AgentChatPanel`) built on the Vercel AI SDK (`Experimental_Agent` + `@ai-sdk/vue`)
-   **Browser-side LLM configuration** — API keys for OpenAI, Anthropic, or OpenAI-compatible endpoints stay in the client (encrypted in `localStorage`)
-   **Phase 1 CAD tools** — `get_drawing_context`; `draw_line`, `draw_circle`, `draw_arc`, `draw_rectangle`, `draw_polyline`, `draw_text`; `set_current_layer`, `create_layer`, `zoom_extents`
-   **English / Chinese** UI strings via the plugin i18n layer

The full Vue `cad-viewer` app registers the agent automatically when the package is installed (palette tab). `cad-simple-viewer-example` wires it into a dock tab via `cad-simple-ui-plugin`. Host apps call `registerLazyAgentPlugin` and `setAgentPaletteOpener` to mount the panel where they want.

→ **Installation, registration, and tool list:** packages/cad-agent-plugin/README.md

### Export plugins (HTML / PDF / SVG)

These plugins add export (and PDF import) commands to the same plugin manager. They are **lazy-loaded** so initial page weight stays small. The `cad-simple-viewer-example` demo registers all three export plugins, `cad-simple-ui-plugin`, and `cad-agent-plugin`; the full `cad-viewer` app registers the export plugins and the agent plugin (when installed) in its bootstrap.

-   **HTML** — one-file offline viewer for sharing and archiving: packages/cad-html-plugin/README.md  
    (Headless CLI using the same pipeline: packages/cad-html-exporter-cli/README.md)
-   **PDF** — vector PDF export and PDF-to-CAD import: packages/cad-pdf-plugin/README.md
-   **SVG** — vector SVG export: packages/cad-svg-plugin/README.md

#### Self-contained HTML memory usage

When opening the sample drawing `canteen.dwg`, memory consumption is roughly:

Viewer

Memory consumption

AutoCAD 2020

320 MB

GstarCAD Viewer (浩辰看图王)

246 MB

Self-contained HTML (measure mode)

56 MB

Self-contained HTML (view mode)

33 MB

The offline HTML viewer uses about **83% less memory than AutoCAD 2020** and about **77% less than GstarCAD Viewer** in view mode, while still supporting pan/zoom, layer toggle, and distance measurement (measure mode).

Performance
-----------

CAD-Viewer is engineered for **exceptional performance** and can handle very large DXF/DWG files while maintaining high frame rates. It employs multiple advanced rendering technologies to optimize performance:

-   **Custom Shader Materials**: Uses GPU-accelerated shader materials to render complex line types and hatch fill patterns efficiently
-   **Geometry Batching**: Merges points, lines, and areas with the same material to dramatically reduce draw calls
-   **Instanced Rendering**: Optimizes rendering of repeated geometries through instancing techniques
-   **Buffer Geometry Optimization**: Efficient memory management and geometry merging for reduced GPU overhead
-   **Material Caching**: Reuses materials across similar entities to minimize state changes
-   **WebGL Optimization**: Leverages modern WebGL features for hardware-accelerated rendering

These optimizations enable CAD-Viewer to smoothly render complex CAD drawings with thousands of entities while maintaining responsive user interactions.

Known Issues
------------

CAD-Viewer has some known limitations that users should be aware of:

-   **Unsupported Entities**:
    
    -   **XRefs**: External references (XRefs) are not currently supported. This is mainly because file access in the browser works differently from desktop CAD applications. Support for XRefs is planned for a future release.
-   **DWG File Compatibility**:
    
    -   Some DWG drawings may fail to open due to bugs in the underlying LibreDWG library. This is a known limitation of the current DWG parsing implementation. If you find those issues, please log one issue on CAD-Viewer issues page or LibreDWG issues page.
    -   Drawings that contain third-party custom entities (e.g., Tianzheng drawings in the Chinese architecture and construction industry) may not display correctly unless proxy graphics are saved. When saving such drawings, ensure the system variable `PROXYGRAPHICS` is set to `1`. If proxy graphics are embedded in the file, CAD-Viewer can display them.
    
    Whether proxy graphics are written when saving a DWG is controlled by the system variable `PROXYGRAPHICS`:
    
    Value
    
    Meaning
    
    0
    
    Do not save proxy graphics
    
    1
    
    Save proxy graphics
    
-   **DWG File Size Limits**:
    
    -   Parsing DWG files with LibreDWG is memory-intensive and can easily exceed 2 GB of RAM. `libredwg-web` therefore enforces WASM heap memory limits; very large DWG files may fail to parse.
    -   We offer a **proprietary DWG/DXF parser** with significantly lower memory usage, support for larger files, and more accurate parsing. It integrates with the same `@mlightcad/data-model` as the open-source converters and can replace the GPL-based `dxf-json-converter` and `libredwg-converter` stack for closed-source commercial products. See the commercial license document for scope, pricing, GPL compliance, and support terms.

Contributing
------------

Contributions are welcome! Please open issues or pull requests for bug fixes, new features, or suggestions. For bug reports, providing a link to the problematic drawing will help in reproducing and fixing the issue.

License
-------

The cad-viewer monorepo is primarily MIT licensed.

The **default DXF/DWG loading path** in `@mlightcad/cad-simple-viewer` depends on GPL-3.0 packages (`dxf-json` / `@mlightcad/dxf-json-converter` for DXF, `libredwg-web` / `@mlightcad/libredwg-converter` for DWG). If you ship a closed-source product and cannot distribute GPL code to your customers, use the **proprietary DWG/DXF parser** instead — it replaces those converters and lets the rest of the stack remain MIT-only.
