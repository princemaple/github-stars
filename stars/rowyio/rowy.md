Quick guided install
--------------------

Set up Rowy on your Google Cloud Platform project with this easy deploy button. Your data and cloud functions stay on your own Firestore/GCP and is managed via a cloud run instance that operates exclusively on your GCP project. So we do not access or store any of your data on Rowy.
