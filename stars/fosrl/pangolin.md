Pangolin is an open-source, identity-based remote access platform built on WireGuard that enables secure, seamless connectivity to private and public resources. Pangolin combines reverse proxy and VPN capabilities into one platform, providing browser-based access to web applications and client-based access to any private resources, all with zero-trust security and granular access control.

Key Features
------------

**Connect remote networks with sites**  
  
Pangolin's lightweight site connectors create secure tunnels from remote networks without requiring public IP addresses or open ports. Sites make any network anywhere available for authorized access.

**Browser-based reverse proxy access**  
  
Expose web applications through identity and context-aware tunneled reverse proxies. Pangolin handles routing, load balancing, health checking, and automatic SSL certificates without exposing your network directly to the internet. Users access applications through any web browser with authentication and granular access control.

**Client-based private resource access**  
  
Access private resources like SSH servers, databases, RDP, and entire network ranges through Pangolin clients. Intelligent NAT traversal enables connections even through restrictive firewalls, while DNS aliases provide friendly names and fast connections to resources across all your sites.

**Zero-trust granular access**  
  
Grant users access to specific resources, not entire networks. Unlike traditional VPNs that expose full network access, Pangolin's zero-trust model ensures users can only reach the applications and services you explicitly define, reducing security risk and attack surface.
