Lapce
========

#### Lightning-fast And Powerful Code Editor

  

Lapce (IPA: /læps/) is written in pure Rust, with a UI in Floem. It is designed with Rope Science from the Xi-Editor, enabling lightning-fast computation, and leverages wgpu for rendering. More information about the features of Lapce can be found on the main website and user documentation can be found on GitBook.

Features
--------

-   Built-in LSP (Language Server Protocol) support to give you intelligent code features such as: completion, diagnostics and code actions
-   Modal editing support as first class citizen (Vim-like, and toggleable)
-   Built-in remote development support inspired by VSCode Remote Development. Enjoy the benefits of a "local" experience, and seamlessly gain the full power of a remote system. We also have Lapdev which can help manage your remote dev environments.
-   Plugins can be written in programming languages that can compile to the WASI format (C, Rust, AssemblyScript)
-   Built-in terminal, so you can execute commands in your workspace, without leaving Lapce.

Installation
------------

You can find pre-built releases for Windows, Linux and macOS here, or installing with a package manager. If you'd like to compile from source, you can find the guide.

Contributing

Lapdev, developed by the Lapce team, is a cloud dev env service similar to GitHub Codespaces. By clicking the button above, you'll be taken to a fully set up Lapce dev env where you can browse the code and start developing. All dependencies are pre-installed, so you can get straight to code.
