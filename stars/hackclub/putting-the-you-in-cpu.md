Putting the "You" in CPU
========================

A technical explainer of how your computer runs programs, from start to finish.

by @kognise and @hackclub

  

From the beginning...
---------------------

I've done a lot of things with computers, but I've always had a gap in my knowledge: what exactly happens when you run a program on your computer? I thought about this gap — I had most of the requisite low-level knowledge, but I was struggling to piece everything together. Are programs really executing directly on the CPU, or is something else going on? I've used syscalls, but how do they _work_? What are they, really? How do multiple programs run at the same time?

I cracked and started figuring as much out as possible. There aren't many comprehensive systems resources if you aren't going to college, so I had to sift through tons of different sources of varying quality and sometimes conflicting information. A couple weeks of research and almost 40 pages of notes later, I think I have a much better idea of how computers work from startup to program execution. I would've killed for one solid article explaining what I learned, so I'm writing the article that I wished I had.

And you know what they say... you only truly understand something if you can explain it to someone else.

> In a hurry? Feel like you know this stuff already?

> Read chapter 3 and I guarantee you will learn something new. Unless you're like, Linus Torvalds himself.
