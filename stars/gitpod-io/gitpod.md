**Gitpod has been renamed to Ona - mission control for software projects and software engineering agents**. We no longer recommend this version of Gitpod, users should take advantage of Ona's free tier or contact sales for enterprise. With Ona you gain more powerful development environments than Gitpod Classic with industry-standard specifications based on Dev Container and Ona Agents.

Gitpod Classic
--------------

Gitpod Classic is a developer platform providing on-demand, pre-configured development environments in the cloud. It allows developers to spin up secure workspaces with a simple .gitpod.yml configuration file, eliminating the need for manual environment setup. The platform integrates seamlessly with GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, and Azure DevOps, offering features like prebuilt environments, collaborative code reviews, and professional developer experience with VS Code extensions and customization options. Workspaces are ephemeral, secure, and based on Docker, providing developers with the same capabilities as their local Linux machines but in a consistent, reproducible cloud environment.

> **Important: Gitpod Classic pay-as-you-go will sunset on October 15th** 2025 (this date does not apply to Enterprise customers). All existing pay-as-you-go users should migrate to Ona before this date. See our blog for detailed instructions.

During the development of Gitpod, we also developed some of our infrastructure toolings to make development easier and more efficient. To this end, we've developed many open-source projects including:

-   Workspace images: Ready to use docker images for Gitpod workspaces
-   OpenVSCode Server: Run the latest VS Code on a remote machine accessed through a browser
-   Gitpod browser extension: It adds a Gitpod button to the configured GitLab, GitHub, Bitbucket and Azure DevOps installations
