labuladong Algo Notes
=====================

This repository contains 60+ original articles based on LeetCode problems, covering all problem types and techniques. The goal is to help you **think algorithmically** — not just memorize solutions.

When it comes to LeetCode, what matters is not the answer itself, but the **thought process** behind it. A repository full of raw code without explanation isn't very useful. The real value lies in understanding the frameworks and patterns that let you solve new problems on your own.

Most people grind LeetCode to land a job, not to compete in programming contests. So the focus here is on **clarity and practical understanding** — building reusable mental frameworks that make algorithm problems approachable and solvable.

Before You Start
----------------

**1\. Give this repo a star** if you find it helpful — it keeps me motivated to write more.

**2\. I recommend studying on my website, where each article links to the corresponding LeetCode problems so you can read and practice side by side. The site covers 500+ problems with step-by-step guidance:**
