### Standing on the Shoulders of Giants

In addition to the good idea of decentralized chat, it also leverages some fantastic technologies.

-   **remesh**: A framework in JavaScript that implements DDD principles, achieving true separation of UI and logic, allowing for easy implementation of the UI part, such as rewriting it in Vue, due to its independence from the UI.
    
-   **shadcn/ui**: A beautiful UI library and a pioneer of the no-install concept, offering unmatched convenience in customizing styles.
    
-   **wxt**: This is the best framework I’ve used for building browser extensions, bar none.
    
-   **trystero**: The core dependency for implementing decentralized communication, enabling connections to decentralized networks like IPFS, torrent, Nostr, etc.
    
-   **Artico**: A flexible set of libraries that help you create your own WebRTC-based solutions
    
-   **ugly-avatar**: Use it to create stunning random avatars.
