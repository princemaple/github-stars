-   **Contributing non-code**. Report an issue, translate Zulip into your language, or give us feedback. We'd love to hear from you, whether you've been using Zulip for years, or are just trying it out for the first time.
    
-   **Checking Zulip out**. The best way to see Zulip in action is to drop by the Zulip community server. We also recommend reading about Zulip's unique approach to organizing conversations.
