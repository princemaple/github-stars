Workbox is a powerful library originally developed by members of Chrome's developer relations team to facilitate the creation of Progressive Web Apps and to improve the offline experience of web applications. It offers a suite of tools and strategies for efficiently caching and serving web assets, managing service workers, and handling offline scenarios. Workbox simplifies the implementation of common caching patterns and provides developers with a comprehensive toolkit to build robust, resilient web applications. From now on, Chrome's Aurora team will be the new owners of Workbox.
