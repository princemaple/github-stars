Tesseract.js is a javascript library that gets words in almost any language out of images. (Demo)

Image Recognition

Video Real-time Recognition

Tesseract.js wraps a webassembly port of the Tesseract OCR Engine. It works in the browser using webpack, esm, or plain script tags with a CDN and on the server with Node.js. After you install it, using it is as simple as:

import { createWorker } from 'tesseract.js';

(async () \=> {
  const worker \= await createWorker('eng');
  const ret \= await worker.recognize('https://tesseract.projectnaptha.com/img/eng\_bw.png');
  console.log(ret.data.text);
  await worker.terminate();
})();

When recognizing multiple images, users should create a worker once, run `worker.recognize` for each image, and then run `worker.terminate()` once at the end (rather than running the above snippet for every image).

Installation
------------

Tesseract.js works with a `<script>` tag via local copy or CDN, with webpack via `npm` and on Node.js with `npm/yarn`.

### CDN

<!-- v5 -->
<script src\='https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tesseract.js@5/dist/tesseract.min.js'\></script\>

After including the script the `Tesseract` variable will be globally available and a worker can be created using `Tesseract.createWorker`.

Alternatively, an ESM build (used with `import` syntax) can be found at `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/tesseract.js@5/dist/tesseract.esm.min.js`.

### Node.js

**Requires Node.js v14 or higher**

# For latest version
npm install tesseract.js
yarn add tesseract.js

# For old versions
npm install tesseract.js@3.0.3
yarn add tesseract.js@3.0.3

If you have a project or example repo that uses Tesseract.js, feel free to add it to this list using a pull request. Examples submitted should be well documented such that new users can run them; projects should be functional and actively maintained.

Major changes in v5
-------------------

Version 5 changes are documented in this issue. Highlights are below.

-   Significantly smaller files by default (54% smaller for English, 73% smaller for Chinese)
    -   This results in a ~50% reduction in runtime for first-time users (who do not have the files cached yet)
-   Significantly lower memory usage
-   Compatible with iOS 17 (using default settings)
-   Breaking changes:
    -   `createWorker` arguments changed
        -   Setting non-default language and OEM now happens in `createWorker`
            -   E.g. `createWorker("chi_sim", 1)`
    -   `worker.initialize` and `worker.loadLanguage` functions now do nothing and can be deleted from code
    -   See this issue for full list

Upgrading from v2 to v5? See this guide.

Major changes in v4
-------------------

Version 4 includes many new features and bug fixes--see this issue for a full list. Several highlights are below.

-   Added rotation preprocessing options (including auto-rotate) for significantly better accuracy
-   Processed images (rotated, grayscale, binary) can now be retrieved
-   Improved support for parallel processing (schedulers)
-   Breaking changes:
    -   `createWorker` is now async
    -   `getPDF` function replaced by `pdf` recognize option

Major changes in v3
-------------------

-   Significantly faster performance
    -   Runtime reduction of 84% for Browser and 96% for Node.js when recognizing the example images
-   Upgrade to Tesseract v5.1.0 (using emscripten 3.1.18)
-   Added SIMD-enabled build for supported devices
-   Added support:
    -   Node.js version 18
-   Removed support:
    -   ASM.js version, any other old versions of Tesseract.js-core (<3.0.0)
    -   Node.js versions 10 and 12

Contributing
------------

### Development

To run a development copy of Tesseract.js do the following:

# First we clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/naptha/tesseract.js.git
cd tesseract.js

# Then we install the dependencies
npm install

# And finally we start the development server
npm start

The development server will be available at http://localhost:3000/examples/browser/basic-efficient.html in your favorite browser. It will automatically rebuild `tesseract.min.js` and `worker.min.js` when you change files in the **src** folder.

### Online Setup with a single Click

You can use Gitpod(A free online VS Code like IDE) for contributing. With a single click it will launch a ready to code workspace with the build & start scripts already in process and within a few seconds it will spin up the dev server so that you can start contributing straight away without wasting any time.

### Building Static Files

To build the compiled static files just execute the following:

npm run build

This will output the files into the `dist` directory.
