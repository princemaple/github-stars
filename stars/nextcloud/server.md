### Development setup 👩‍💻

1.  🚀 Set up your local development environment
2.  🐛 Pick a good first issue
3.  👩‍🔧 Create a branch and make your changes. Remember to sign off your commits using `git commit -sm "Your commit message"`
4.  ⬆ Create a pull request and `@mention` the people from the issue to review
5.  👍 Fix things that come up during a review
6.  🎉 Wait for it to get merged!

Third-party components are handled as git submodules which have to be initialized first. So aside from the regular git checkout invoking `git submodule update --init` or a similar command is needed, for details see Git documentation.

Several apps that are included by default in regular releases such as First run wizard or Activity are missing in `master` and have to be installed manually by cloning them into the `apps` subfolder.

Otherwise, git checkouts can be handled the same as release archives, by using the `stable*` branches. Note they should never be used on production systems.

### Tools we use 🛠

-   👀 BrowserStack for cross-browser testing
-   🌊 WAVE for accessibility testing
-   🚨 Lighthouse for testing performance, accessibility, and more

#### Helpful bots at GitHub 🤖

-   Comment on a pull request with `/update-3rdparty` to update the 3rd party submodule. It will update to the last commit of the 3rd party branch named like the PR target.

#### Ignore code style updates in git blame

`git config blame.ignoreRevsFile .git-blame-ignore-revs`
