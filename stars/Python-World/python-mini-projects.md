Python-Mini-Projects
====================

A collection of simple python mini projects to enhance your Python skills.

If you want to learn about python, visit here.

If you are new to Github and open source then, visit here.

Steps To Follow
---------------

-   Select an issue and ask to be _assigned_ to it.
    
-   Check existing scripts in the projects directory.
    
-   **Star** this repository.
    
-   On the python-mini-projects repo page, click the **Fork** button.  
    
-   **Clone** your forked repository to your local machine. This button will show you the URL to run.  
    
    For example, run this command inside your terminal:
    
    git clone https://github.com/<your-github-username\>/python-mini-projects.git
    
    **Replace <your-github-username>!**
    
    Learn more about forking and cloning a repo.
    
-   Before you make any changes, keep your fork in sync to avoid merge conflicts:
    
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/Python-World/python-mini-projects.git
    git fetch upstream
    git pull upstream master
    git push
    
    Alternatively, GitHub also provides syncing now - click "Fetch upstream" at the top of your repo below "Code" button.
    
-   If you run into a **merge conflict**, you have to resolve the conflict. There are a lot of guides online, or you can try this one by opensource.com.
    
-   Checkout to development branch (_name your branch according to the issue name_).
    
    git checkout -b <branch-name\>
    
-   Create a folder in projects directory according to issue name.
    
-   Write your code and add to the respective folder in the projects directory, locally.
    
-   Don't forget to add a `README.md` in your folder, according to the README\_TEMPLATE.
    
-   Add the changes with `git add`, `git commit` (write a good commit message, if possible):
    
    git add -A
    git commit -m "<your message>"
    
-   Push the code _to your repository_.
    
    git push origin <branch-name\>
    
-   Go to the GitHub page of _your fork_, and **make a pull request**:
    
    Read more about pull requests on the GitHub help pages.
    
-   Now wait, until one of us _reviews your Pull Request_! If there are any conflicts, you will get a notification.
