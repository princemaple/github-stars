Files is a modern file manager that helps users organize their files and folders. Our mission with Files is to build the best file manager for Windows, and we’re proud to be building it out in the open so everyone can participate.

Built and maintained by the open-source community, Files features robust multitasking experiences, file tags, deep integrations, and an intuitive design.
