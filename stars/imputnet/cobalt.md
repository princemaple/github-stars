### ethics

cobalt is a tool that makes downloading public content easier. it takes **zero liability**. the end user is responsible for what they download, how they use and distribute that content. cobalt never caches any content, it works like a fancy proxy.

cobalt is in no way a piracy tool and cannot be used as such. it can only download free & publicly accessible content. same content can be downloaded via dev tools of any modern web browser.
