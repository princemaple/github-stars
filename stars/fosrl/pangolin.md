Pangolin is a self-hosted tunneled reverse proxy server with identity and context aware access control, designed to easily expose and protect applications running anywhere. Pangolin acts as a central hub and connects isolated networks — even those behind restrictive firewalls — through encrypted tunnels, enabling easy access to remote services without opening ports or requiring a VPN.

Key Features
------------

Pangolin packages everything you need for seamless application access and exposure into one cohesive platform.

**Manage applications in one place**  
  
Pangolin provides a unified dashboard where you can monitor, configure, and secure all of your services regardless of where they are hosted.

**Reverse proxy across networks anywhere**  
  
Route traffic via tunnels to any private network. Pangolin works like a reverse proxy that spans multiple networks and handles routing, load balancing, health checking, and more to the right services on the other end.

**Enforce identity and context aware rules**  
  
Protect your applications with identity and context aware rules such as SSO, OIDC, PIN, password, temporary share links, geolocation, IP, and more.

**Quickly connect Pangolin sites**  
  
Pangolin's lightweight Newt client runs in userspace and can run anywhere. Use it as a site connector to route traffic to backends across all of your environments.
