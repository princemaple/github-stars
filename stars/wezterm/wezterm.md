Getting help
------------

This is a spare time project, so please bear with me. There are a couple of channels for support:

-   You can use the GitHub issue tracker to see if someone else has a similar issue, or to file a new one.
-   Start or join a thread in our GitHub Discussions; if you have general questions or want to chat with other wezterm users, you're welcome here!
-   There is a Matrix room via Element.io for (potentially!) real time discussions.

The GitHub Discussions and Element/Gitter rooms are better suited for questions than bug reports, but don't be afraid to use whichever you are most comfortable using and we'll work it out.
