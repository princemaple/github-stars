OpenClaw 🦞 — Your assistant, on your devices, in your chats
============================================================

OpenClaw is an open-source AI assistant that runs on your own computer and meets you in the channels you already use: Discord, iMessage, Slack, Teams, Telegram, WhatsApp, and 20+ more, plus native apps for macOS, iOS, Android, Windows, and Linux. One Gateway runs it as a personal assistant on a laptop or as a shared team deployment; configuration is the only difference.

**Yours, with no catch.** State, memory, and credentials live on your hardware. Models and agent harnesses (Claude, Codex, local models) are plugins you can swap without changing anything else. Your prompts go to the model provider and chat platforms you configure, plus any diagnostics export you enable yourself; by default OpenClaw itself phones home for nothing but a daily version check, anonymous feature statistics are opt-in, and `update.checkOnStart: false` disables both (what OpenClaw sends). OpenClaw is stewarded by the OpenClaw Foundation, an independent 501(c)(3), and has no paid tier, hosted service, or token. The architecture case — trusted gateway, untrusted execution, deterministic policy — is in Why OpenClaw.

Install
-------

The installer supports macOS, Linux, and Windows. It provisions a supported Node.js runtime when needed.

# macOS / Linux / WSL2
curl -fsSL https://openclaw.ai/install.sh | bash

# Windows PowerShell
iwr \-useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex

Already manage Node.js? Install the published package instead (Node 24.16+ or 26.1+; Node 26 recommended):

npm install -g openclaw@latest --allow-scripts=openclaw

That command is for npm 12 or npm 11.16+. On npm 11.15 and earlier, omit `--allow-scripts=openclaw`. See the installation guide for the lifecycle script contract, Docker, Nix, and other deployment paths.

Quick start
-----------

On a fresh install, the installer scripts start onboarding automatically. Complete the wizard they open. If you installed the package directly with npm, pnpm, or Bun, run:

openclaw onboard --install-daemon

After onboarding:

openclaw gateway status
openclaw dashboard

Onboarding verifies model access, creates the workspace, and configures the Gateway. The last command opens the Control UI; send a message there to confirm the assistant is working. See the getting started guide for channel setup and troubleshooting.

How it fits together
--------------------

-   The Gateway is the local control plane for sessions, tools, events, and channel connections.
-   The Control UI, CLI, and TUI connect to the Gateway.
-   Channels bring the assistant to WhatsApp, Telegram, Slack, Discord, Google Chat, Signal, iMessage, and other messaging services.
-   Companion apps and nodes add voice, Canvas, camera, screen, and device-local actions on supported platforms.

OpenClaw works with hosted and local model providers. Its tools, skills, and plugins extend what an assistant can do.

Security
--------

Treat inbound messages as untrusted input. DM-capable channels pair unknown senders by default; approve a pairing request with `openclaw pairing approve <channel> <code>`.

Tools run on the host for the main session unless you configure sandboxing. Read the security guide, exposure runbook, and sandboxing guide before connecting other users or exposing the Gateway remotely.

Development
-----------

The repository is a pnpm workspace. Plain `npm install` at the repository root is not supported.

git clone https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw.git
cd openclaw
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm ui:build

See CONTRIBUTING.md for the contribution workflow and the source setup guide for the development loop.

Governance
----------

OpenClaw is developed in the open by the OpenClaw Foundation, an independent 501(c)(3). The Foundation employs the core team and signs releases. Donors and infrastructure sponsors support the Foundation; none of them own or direct the project. OpenAI is a donor, not an owner.

Community
---------

See CONTRIBUTING.md for maintainers and contribution guidelines; AI-assisted PRs are welcome.

Use the issue chooser for bugs and feature requests, ask setup questions in Discord, and report vulnerabilities through SECURITY.md. New capabilities usually belong in plugins built on the plugin SDK and shared through ClawHub.

OpenClaw was built for **Molty**, a space lobster AI assistant, by Peter Steinberger and the community. Explore the project lore, soul.md, Peter's site, Star History, and @openclaw.

Special thanks to Mario Zechner for his support and for pi, and to Adam Doppelt for the lobster.bot domain.

Donors and sponsors
-------------------

The Foundation is funded by donors including the University of Michigan, OpenAI, Amazon, Red Hat, Offline Holdings, and Lobster Computer Company, with infrastructure support from GitHub, NVIDIA, Vercel, Blacksmith, and Convex.
