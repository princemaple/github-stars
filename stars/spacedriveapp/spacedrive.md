Spacedrive
==========

A file manager built on a virtual distributed filesystem  
**spacedrive.com** · **v2 Documentation** · **Discord**

Spacedrive is an open source cross-platform file manager, powered by a virtual distributed filesystem (VDFS) written in Rust.

Organize files across multiple devices, clouds, and platforms from a single interface. Tag once, access everywhere. Never lose track of where your files are.

Important

**v2.0.0-alpha.1 Released: December 26, 2025**

This is Spacedrive v2—a complete ground-up rewrite. After development of the original alpha version stopped in January this year, I rebuilt Spacedrive from scratch with the hard lessons learned.

**Current status:** Alpha release for macOS and Linux. Windows support coming in alpha.2. Mobile apps (iOS/Android) coming soon.

**Download Release** · Visit v2.spacedrive.com for complete documentation and guides.

The Problem
-----------

Computing was designed for a single-device world. The file managers we use today—Finder, Explorer, Files—were built when your data lived in one place: the computer in front of you.

The shift to multi-device computing forced us into cloud ecosystems. Want your files everywhere? Upload them to someone else's servers. The convenience came at a cost: **data ownership**. This wasn't accidental—centralization was the path of least resistance for solving multi-device sync.

Now AI is accelerating this trend. Cloud services offer intelligent file analysis and semantic search, but only if you upload your data to their infrastructure. As we generate more data and AI becomes more capable, we're giving away more and more to access basic computing conveniences.

**The current system isn't built for a world where:**

-   You own multiple devices with underutilized compute and storage
-   Local AI models are becoming competitive with cloud alternatives
-   Privacy and data sovereignty matter
-   You shouldn't have to choose between convenience and control

The Vision
----------

Spacedrive is infrastructure for the next era of computing. It's an architecture designed for multi-device environments from the ground up—not cloud services retrofitted with offline support, but local-first sync that scales to the cloud when you want it.

As local AI models improve, Spacedrive becomes the fabric that enables the same insights cloud services offer today, but running on hardware you already own, on data that never leaves your control. This is a long-term project correcting computing's trajectory toward centralization.

The file explorer interface is deliberate. Everyone understands it. It's seen the least innovation in decades. And it has the most potential when you bake distributed computing, content awareness, and local AI into something universally familiar.

How It Works
------------

Spacedrive treats files as **first-class objects with content identity**, not paths. A photo on your laptop and the same photo on your NAS are recognized as one piece of content. This enables:

-   **Content-aware deduplication** - Track redundancy across all devices
-   **Semantic search** - Find files in under 100ms across millions of entries
-   **Transactional operations** - Preview conflicts, space savings, and outcomes before execution
-   **Peer-to-peer sync** - No servers, no consensus protocols, no single point of failure
-   **Offline-first** - Full functionality without internet, syncs when devices reconnect

Files stay where they are. Spacedrive just makes them universally addressable with rich metadata and cross-device intelligence.

* * *

Architecture
------------

Spacedrive is built on four core principles:

### 1\. Virtual Distributed Filesystem (VDFS)

Files and folders become first-class objects with rich metadata, independent of their physical location. Every file gets a universal address (`SdPath`) that works across devices. Content-aware addressing means you can reference files by what they contain, not just where they live.

### 2\. Content Identity System

Adaptive hashing (BLAKE3 with strategic sampling for large files) creates a unique fingerprint for every piece of content. This enables:

-   **Deduplication**: Recognize identical files across devices
-   **Redundancy tracking**: Know where your backups are
-   **Content-based operations**: "Copy this file from wherever it's available"

### 3\. Transactional Actions

Every file operation can be previewed before execution. See exactly what will happen—space savings, conflicts, estimated time—then approve or cancel. Operations become durable jobs that survive network interruptions and device restarts.

### 4\. Leaderless Sync

Peer-to-peer synchronization without central coordinators. Device-specific data (your filesystem index) uses state replication. Shared metadata (tags, ratings) uses a lightweight HLC-ordered log with deterministic conflict resolution. No leader election, no single point of failure.

Getting Started
---------------

### Prerequisites

-   **Rust** 1.81+ (rustup)
-   **Bun** 1.3+ (bun.sh) - For Tauri desktop app

### Quick Start with Desktop App (Tauri)

Spacedrive runs as a daemon (`sd-daemon`) that manages your libraries and P2P connections. The Tauri desktop app can launch its own daemon instance, or connect to a daemon started by the CLI.

# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/spacedriveapp/spacedrive
cd spacedrive

# Install dependencies
bun install
cargo run -p xtask -- setup  # generates .cargo/config.toml with aliases
cargo build # builds all core and apps (including the daemon and cli)

# Copy dependencies into the debug Folder ( probably windows only )
Copy-Item -Path "apps\\.deps\\lib\\\*.dll" -Destination "target\\debug" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Copy-Item -Path "apps\\.deps\\bin\\\*.dll" -Destination "target\\debug" -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Run the desktop app (automatically starts daemon)
cd apps/tauri
bun run tauri:dev

### Quick Start with CLI

The CLI can manage libraries and run a persistent daemon that other apps connect to:

# Build and run the CLI
cargo run -p sd-cli -- --help

# Start the daemon (runs in background)
cargo run -p sd-cli -- daemon start

# Create a library
cargo run -p sd-cli -- library create "My Library"

# Add a location to index
cargo run -p sd-cli -- location add ~/Documents

# Search indexed files
cargo run -p sd-cli -- search .

# Now launch Tauri app - it will connect to the running daemon

### Running Tests

Spacedrive has a comprehensive test suite covering single-device operations and multi-device networking scenarios.

# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run specific test
cargo test test\_device\_pairing --nocapture

# Run with detailed logging
RUST\_LOG=debug cargo test test\_name --nocapture

# Run core tests only
cargo test -p sd-core

See the Testing Guide for detailed documentation on:

-   Integration test framework
-   Multi-device subprocess testing
-   Event monitoring patterns
-   Test helpers and utilities

All integration tests are in `core/tests/` including device pairing, sync, file transfer, and job execution tests.

### Development Commands

# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run tests for specific package
cargo test -p sd-core

# Build CLI in release mode
cargo build -p sd-cli --release

# Format code
cargo fmt

# Run lints
cargo clippy

Privacy & Security
------------------

Spacedrive is **local-first**. Your data stays on your devices.

-   **End-to-End Encryption**: All P2P traffic encrypted via QUIC/TLS
-   **At-Rest Encryption**: Libraries can be encrypted on disk (SQLCipher)
-   **No Telemetry**: Zero tracking or analytics in the open source version
-   **Self-Hostable**: Run your own relay servers and cloud cores
-   **Data Sovereignty**: You control where your data lives

Optional cloud integration (Spacedrive Cloud) is available for backup and remote access, but it's never required. The cloud service runs unmodified Spacedrive core as a standard P2P device—no special privileges, no custom APIs.
