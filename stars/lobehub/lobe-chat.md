### Multi-Model Service Provider Support

In the continuous development of LobeChat, we deeply understand the importance of diversity in model service providers for meeting the needs of the community when providing AI conversation services. Therefore, we have expanded our support to multiple model service providers, rather than being limited to a single one, in order to offer users a more diverse and rich selection of conversations.

In this way, LobeChat can more flexibly adapt to the needs of different users, while also providing developers with a wider range of choices.

#### Supported Model Service Providers

We have implemented support for the following model service providers:

> 📊 Total providers: **0**

At the same time, we are also planning to support more model service providers. If you would like LobeChat to support your favorite service provider, feel free to join our 💬 community discussion.

### Local Large Language Model (LLM) Support

To meet the specific needs of users, LobeChat also supports the use of local models based on Ollama, allowing users to flexibly use their own or third-party models.

Tip

Learn more about 📘 Using Ollama in LobeChat by checking it out.

### Model Visual Recognition

LobeChat now supports OpenAI's latest `gpt-4-vision` model with visual recognition capabilities, a multimodal intelligence that can perceive visuals. Users can easily upload or drag and drop images into the dialogue box, and the agent will be able to recognize the content of the images and engage in intelligent conversation based on this, creating smarter and more diversified chat scenarios.

This feature opens up new interactive methods, allowing communication to transcend text and include a wealth of visual elements. Whether it's sharing images in daily use or interpreting images within specific industries, the agent provides an outstanding conversational experience.

### TTS & STT Voice Conversation

LobeChat supports Text-to-Speech (TTS) and Speech-to-Text (STT) technologies, enabling our application to convert text messages into clear voice outputs, allowing users to interact with our conversational agent as if they were talking to a real person. Users can choose from a variety of voices to pair with the agent.

Moreover, TTS offers an excellent solution for those who prefer auditory learning or desire to receive information while busy. In LobeChat, we have meticulously selected a range of high-quality voice options (OpenAI Audio, Microsoft Edge Speech) to meet the needs of users from different regions and cultural backgrounds. Users can choose the voice that suits their personal preferences or specific scenarios, resulting in a personalized communication experience.

### Text to Image Generation

With support for the latest text-to-image generation technology, LobeChat now allows users to invoke image creation tools directly within conversations with the agent. By leveraging the capabilities of AI tools such as `DALL-E 3`, `MidJourney`, and `Pollinations`, the agents are now equipped to transform your ideas into images.

This enables a more private and immersive creative process, allowing for the seamless integration of visual storytelling into your personal dialogue with the agent.

### Plugin System (Function Calling)

The plugin ecosystem of LobeChat is an important extension of its core functionality, greatly enhancing the practicality and flexibility of the LobeChat assistant.

Plugin-Demo.mp4

By utilizing plugins, LobeChat assistants can obtain and process real-time information, such as searching for web information and providing users with instant and relevant news.

In addition, these plugins are not limited to news aggregation, but can also extend to other practical functions, such as quickly searching documents, generating images, obtaining data from various platforms like Bilibili, Steam, and interacting with various third-party services.

### Support Local / Remote Database

LobeChat supports the use of both server-side and local databases. Depending on your needs, you can choose the appropriate deployment solution:

-   **Local database**: suitable for users who want more control over their data and privacy protection. LobeChat uses CRDT (Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type) technology to achieve multi-device synchronization. This is an experimental feature aimed at providing a seamless data synchronization experience.
-   **Server-side database**: suitable for users who want a more convenient user experience. LobeChat supports PostgreSQL as a server-side database. For detailed documentation on how to configure the server-side database, please visit Configure Server-side Database.

Regardless of which database you choose, LobeChat can provide you with an excellent user experience.

### Support Multi-User Management

LobeChat supports multi-user management and provides two main user authentication and management solutions to meet different needs:

-   **next-auth**: LobeChat integrates `next-auth`, a flexible and powerful identity verification library that supports multiple authentication methods, including OAuth, email login, credential login, etc. With `next-auth`, you can easily implement user registration, login, session management, social login, and other functions to ensure the security and privacy of user data.
    
-   **Clerk**: For users who need more advanced user management features, LobeChat also supports `Clerk`, a modern user management platform. `Clerk` provides richer functions, such as multi-factor authentication (MFA), user profile management, login activity monitoring, etc. With `Clerk`, you can get higher security and flexibility, and easily cope with complex user management needs.
    

Regardless of which user management solution you choose, LobeChat can provide you with an excellent user experience and powerful functional support.

### Progressive Web App (PWA)

We deeply understand the importance of providing a seamless experience for users in today's multi-device environment. Therefore, we have adopted Progressive Web Application (PWA) technology, a modern web technology that elevates web applications to an experience close to that of native apps.

Through PWA, LobeChat can offer a highly optimized user experience on both desktop and mobile devices while maintaining high-performance characteristics. Visually and in terms of feel, we have also meticulously designed the interface to ensure it is indistinguishable from native apps, providing smooth animations, responsive layouts, and adapting to different device screen resolutions.

Note

If you are unfamiliar with the installation process of PWA, you can add LobeChat as your desktop application (also applicable to mobile devices) by following these steps:

-   Launch the Chrome or Edge browser on your computer.
-   Visit the LobeChat webpage.
-   In the upper right corner of the address bar, click on the Install icon.
-   Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the PWA Installation.

### Mobile Device Adaptation

We have carried out a series of optimization designs for mobile devices to enhance the user's mobile experience. Currently, we are iterating on the mobile user experience to achieve smoother and more intuitive interactions. If you have any suggestions or ideas, we welcome you to provide feedback through GitHub Issues or Pull Requests.

### Custom Themes

As a design-engineering-oriented application, LobeChat places great emphasis on users' personalized experiences, hence introducing flexible and diverse theme modes, including a light mode for daytime and a dark mode for nighttime. Beyond switching theme modes, a range of color customization options allow users to adjust the application's theme colors according to their preferences. Whether it's a desire for a sober dark blue, a lively peach pink, or a professional gray-white, users can find their style of color choices in LobeChat.

Tip

The default configuration can intelligently recognize the user's system color mode and automatically switch themes to ensure a consistent visual experience with the operating system. For users who like to manually control details, LobeChat also offers intuitive setting options and a choice between chat bubble mode and document mode for conversation scenarios.

### `*` What's more

Beside these features, LobeChat also have much better basic technique underground:

-   💨 **Quick Deployment**: Using the Vercel platform or docker image, you can deploy with just one click and complete the process within 1 minute without any complex configuration.

-   🔒 **Privacy Protection**: All data is stored locally in the user's browser, ensuring user privacy.
-   💎 **Exquisite UI Design**: With a carefully designed interface, it offers an elegant appearance and smooth interaction. It supports light and dark themes and is mobile-friendly. PWA support provides a more native-like experience.
