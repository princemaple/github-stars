The missing documentation tool for your Angular application.  
  

Live Demo
=========

A live demo is available — **see it in action** !

The demo features documentation generated for a simple TodoMVC application.

Features
========

-   **Clean, simple design** — Navigate the documentation on the left side, read it on the right.
    
-   **Beautiful themes** — Seven themes are available from well known documentation tools like Gitbook, Read the Docs and projects like Vagrant, Laravel, Postmark and Stripe.
    
-   **Search** — Includes a powerful search engine (lunr.js) for easily finding what you're looking for.
    
-   **Automatic table of contents** — API table of contents is generated using elements found during files parsing.
    
-   **JSDoc light support** — Support for `@param`, `@returns`, `@link`, `@ignore` and `@example` tags.
    
-   **Documentation coverage** — Get the documentation coverage report of your project.
    
-   **Angular CLI-friendly** — Supports Angular CLI projects out-of-the-box.
    
-   **Offline** — No server needed, no sources uploaded online, documentation generated entirely offline.
    
-   **Open-source and on npm** — Use it directly in your project using npm and a single script—that's it!
